# Foothold

found the svc-name through rpc enumueration. WE used AS-REP roasting to get a TGT from the DC for the svc account. 

We then took the has offline and cracked it with hashcat. Verified the credentials with cme. logged in with CME, uploaded a meterpreter 32 bit rev shell. upgraded to 64 bit.  Ran exploit checker from meterpreter

ran bloodhound.
